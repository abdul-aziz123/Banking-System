# Banking System Documentation

This document provides an overview of the Banking System implemented in C++.

## Overview

The provided C++ code implements a simple banking system. It includes classes such as `Bank`, `Person`, `Account`, and `Customer` to represent various entities involved in banking operations. Users can create accounts, perform transactions like bill payments, cash withdrawals, cash deposits, and funds transfers. Additionally, there are options to view bank details and update bank information.

## Classes

### 1. Bank

- Represents a bank entity with attributes such as name, number, address, and branch number.
- Provides methods to set and get bank details, print bank information, and print heading for bank operations.

### 2. Person

- Represents a person with attributes like account number, name, address, and email.
- Used as a base class for customer.

### 3. Account

- Represents a bank account with attributes such as balance, creation time, and creation date.
- Provides methods for various account operations like bill payment, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, and funds transfer.
- Also provides methods to get creation time and date.

### 4. Customer

- Represents a bank customer extending the `Person` class.
- Contains an `Account` object to manage customer account details.

## Main Functionality

- **Account Creation:** Allows users to create a bank account by providing necessary details like name, account number, address, email, and initial deposit.
- **Bill Payment:** Allows users to pay bills by entering account number, bill number, bill amount, and amount paid.

## Usage

- Users can navigate through the menu displayed in the console to perform various banking operations.
- Input prompts guide users to enter necessary information for each operation.

## Note

- The code uses Windows-specific functions like `Sleep` and `system("cls")`, which may not be portable to other platforms.
- Some parts of the code, such as error handling and input validation, could be improved for robustness and user-friendliness.
